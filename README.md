## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classify cotton plant leaves into healthy or diseased categories.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with a simple interface for easy interaction.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Predict diseases from uploaded images of cotton leaves.
- **Visualization**: Visualize model performance through accuracy and loss graphs.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- scikit-learn (for model evaluation)

## Installation

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib opencv-python scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MalyajNailwal/cotton-plant-disease-prediction.git
   cd cotton-plant-disease-prediction
   ```

2. Prepare your dataset by organizing images into folders representing different classes (e.g., healthy, diseased).

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script provided in the repository and follow the instructions to train the model and make predictions.

4. Upload the image of the cotton leaf for prediction and view the results.

## Data Sources

The dataset used for this project can be sourced from:

- Publicly available datasets on platforms like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).
- Custom datasets collected from agricultural research centers.

Make sure to comply with the data usage policies of these sources.

## Model Architecture

The project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the images. The architecture includes:

- Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
- Pooling layers to reduce dimensionality.
- Fully connected layers for classification.

The model is trained on a dataset of cotton plant images, and hyperparameters can be adjusted for optimization.

## Results

The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and loss. Visualizations will show the training process and performance over epochs, helping to understand how well the model is learning.

Example results include:

- Confusion matrix displaying true vs. predicted classifications.
- Training and validation accuracy/loss curves.
